üõ°Ô∏è Injury Prediction Model for Industrial Safety

This repository contains a predictive machine learning model designed to prevent workplace injuries using historical data. It leverages factory records on shift timings, incident types, departments, and body parts affected, helping occupational health teams proactively plan safety interventions.


---

üìä Objective

To build an AI model that predicts:

The most probable body part to be injured

The most vulnerable department

The likely month of injury occurrence



---

üß† Technologies Used

Python

Pandas & NumPy

Scikit-learn

Google Colab (for development)

Matplotlib & Seaborn (for visualization)

RandomForestClassifier (primary model)



---

üìÅ Dataset Features

Simulated dataset with 3 years of realistic factory injury data including:

Date

Shift

Incident Type

Type of Injury

Department (Encrypted)

Body Part



---

üõ†Ô∏è Workflow

1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing


2. Feature Engineering (Month extraction, label encoding, etc.)


3. Train-Test Split (80:20)


4. Model Training using Random Forest


5. Evaluation using accuracy and classification report


6. Predictions on:

Department at high risk

Body part likely to be injured

Risk month





---

üìà Output

Trained AI model (can be reused on new datasets)

Insightful visualizations on injury patterns

Accuracy metrics of predictive performance


neural network is also created to check the difference in outcome between machine learning model and neural network model.

üöÄ How to Run

1. Open Injury prediction model.ipynb in Google Colab


2. Upload your factory injury dataset or use the simulated data


3. Run all cells step-by-step


4. View predictions and save the trained model




---

üîê Data Privacy

Departments are encrypted for confidentiality

No patient-identifiable data is used



---

üìå Use Case

Ideal for:

Factory safety officers

Occupational health doctors

Industrial engineers
